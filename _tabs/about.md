Welcome to my security blog, where I like to discuss my personal security research, experiences, and opinions on all things security. I'm really interested web hacking and network security.

Here I’ll be posting writeups and CTFs solutions which you can read to learn from me, or to solve the challange with my solution. I’ll also be posting security investigations and proof of concepts I create, within the explanation of the vulnerability.

If you find my blog interesting or want to provide feed back on my post feel free to reach out to me via one of the the contact methods below. You can also contact me by emailing racc0x@racc0x.net.

I'm always happy to chat if you have any questions.
