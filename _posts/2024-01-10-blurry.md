```

## ClearML

At this point, it is important to know what clear ML is and how it works.
After much searching and gathering information, I found that we can connect through a Python package called clearml-agent and create an environment.

During the research process, I found that clearml has a **`CVE-2024-24590: Pickle Load on Artifact Get`**.

## CVE-2024-24590

*ClearML involves the inherent insecurity of pickle files. We discovered that an attacker could create a pickle file containing arbitrary code and upload it as an artifact to a project via the API. When a user calls the get method within the Artifact class to download and load a file into memory, the pickle file is deserialized on their system, running any arbitrary code it contains.*

### Create credentials

To do this, we need to create new credentials to connect through clearml-agent, and to set up, we use the 'init' option.

We press enter on the options and boom, we're connected.

So once connected, we'll proceed to exploit the vulnerability.

## Privilege Escalation
### Sudo -l
Once **I had the reverse shell**, I continued with my enumeration and found a vulnerability with 'sudo -l

![Image](/assets/img/post/blurry/2.png)

I dug into the files and found that when executing /usr/bin/`evaluate_model`, it ran the `demo_model.pth`, which in turn executed the .py file located in `/models/`{: .filepath}. So, I modified the .py file to obtain a reverse shell.

But be careful, it runs with 'sudo' as it doesn't require a password to execute it, so we'll obtain a privileged reverse shell.

```bash
sudo evaluate_model /models/demo_model.pth
```
